It might be fun to simulate quantum entanglement in a text adventure.
Possible uses include:

- Use it for puzzles; the way the player tries to solve the puzzle has a weighted
  impact on its outcome.
- Use it to simulate empathy between AI opponents.
- Let keys be in a superposition until you try to unlock a door.
