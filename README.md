Contributions must adhere to these rules

- Do something fun
- Don't panic

The `experiments` folder is there to try anything you want. Experiments don't have to tie into any existing architecture - we'll figure out how to wire it up later. Any PR adding something
to `experiments` will be approved unless it's overtly off-topic or malicious.
